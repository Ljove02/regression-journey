# 🚀 Regression Journey

A comprehensive exploration of machine learning regression techniques through two real-world case studies:

Predicting student academic performance and SpaceX Falcon 9 landing outcomes.

## 📊 Projects Overview

### 1. 🎓 Student Performance Prediction (Linear Regression)

Predicting student performance index using academic and lifestyle factors.

**Key Features:**

- **Algorithm**: Linear Regression with Polynomial Features (degree 2)
- **Performance**: 98.87% R² accuracy
- **Features**: Study hours, previous scores, extracurricular activities, sleep patterns
- **Techniques**: Feature standardization, polynomial expansion, interactive hyperparameter tuning

### 2. 🚀 Falcon 9 Landing Prediction (Logistic Regression)

Machine learning model to predict SpaceX Falcon 9 first-stage landing success.

**Key Features:**

- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression with Polynomial Features (degree 3) + L2 Regularization
- **Performance**: 89% Precision/Recall/F1-Score, AUC = 0.84
- **Features**: Payload mass, orbit type, technical specs (Block, GridFins, Legs), flight history
- **Techniques**: One-hot encoding, feature engineering, ROC analysis

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

- **Custom ML Library**: Built using custom `kockice` library for deeper algorithmic understanding
- **Interactive Notebooks**: Marimo notebooks with real-time parameter tuning
- **From Scratch**: Manual implementation of gradient descent, loss functions, and evaluation metrics
- **Professional Workflow**: Complete ML pipeline from EDA to model evaluation

## 📈 Results Summary

| Project             | Algorithm           | Accuracy     | Key Insight                                                                    |
| ------------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Student Performance | Linear Regression   | 98.87% R²    | Linear relationships dominate - polynomial features didn't improve performance |
| Falcon 9 Landings   | Logistic Regression | 89% F1-Score | GridFins (0.64) and Legs (0.67) are strongest predictors of landing success    |
